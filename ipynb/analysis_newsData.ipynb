Das heisst, sie dürfen hier arbeiten. Viele von ihnen haben tatsächlich eine Arbeit gefunden, würden aber gerne mehr arbeiten. Das zeigt eine Umfrage der Berner Fachhochschule.     Umfrage bei 2000 Ukrainerinnen und Ukrainern    Box aufklappen Box zuklappen       Die Umfrage wurde von der Berner Fachhochschule im Auftrag des Staatssekretariats für Migration (SEM) im Herbst 2022 durchgeführt. Online wurden 8000 16- bis 59-Jährige angeschrieben. Rund 2000 von ihnen beantworteten die Fragen.    15 Prozent gaben in der Umfrage an, in der Schweiz eine Erwerbsarbeit zu haben. 36 Prozent waren auf Stellensuche, und noch einmal 36 Prozent zeigten sich an einer Arbeit in der Schweiz interessiert. 27 Prozent nehmen an einem Beschäftigungsprogramm oder an einer Ausbildung teil.   Legende:              Die Ukrainerin Olha Shymko war eine der ersten Personen mit Schutzstatus S. Dank diesem fand sie Arbeit in der Küche eines Restaurants.                             Keystone/Anthony Anex/Archiv                Von den Personen, die bereits einer Arbeit nachgehen, würden drei Viertel gerne mehr arbeiten. Dazu wünschen sich die Schutzsuchenden Unterstützung, insbesondere bei der Arbeitssuche und beim Erlernen einer (Landes-)Sprache.\\xa0 Fast die Hälfte arbeitet VollzeitUkrainerinnen und Ukrainer mit Schutzstatus S verdienten im Mittel 4477 Franken im Monat. Es handelt sich um den durchschnittlichen standardisierten Monatslohn, also ein Zwölftel des Brutto-Jahreslohns für ein Vollpensum. Rund zwölf Prozent der Menschen mit Schutzstatus S verdienen über 5000 Franken. Das ergab eine Auswertung der Kantone für die Monate Juli bis September 2022. Eben diese Zahlen zeigen auch, dass die Schutzsuchenden im Mittel ein Arbeitspensum von 70 Prozent hatten. Knapp die Hälfte (46 Prozent) arbeiteten Vollzeit. 98 Prozent waren angestellt und zwei Prozent beruflich selbständig.    Sieben von zehn mit einem HochschulabschlussDie allermeisten der Befragten sind gut ausgebildet. 94.5 Prozent gaben an, über eine nach-obligatorische Ausbildung wie zum Beispiel eine Berufslehre zu verfügen. 70 Prozent verfügen über einen tertiären Abschluss, beispielsweise ein Studium.   Die unter den Menschen mit Status S am häufigsten vertretenen Berufsfelder sind «Wirtschaft, Verwaltung und Recht» sowie «Ingenieurwesen, verarbeitendes Gewerbe und Bau». Die am meisten vertretenen Sektoren sind derweil Gastgewerbe, Planung, Beratung und Informatik, Unterrichtwesen und Landwirtschaft.40 Prozent der Schutzsuchenden gaben an, Englisch gut zu verstehen und sich mündlich ausdrücken zu können. Wie das SEM schrieb, hätten Jüngere deutlich bessere Sprachkenntnisse als Ältere.                 01:59      Video Archiv: Schutzstatus S für Menschen aus Ukraine wird verlängert                                                        Aus Tagesschau vom 09.11.2022.                                                    abspielen.
